# first-aid-buddy

This is my Capstone project for Codecademy's "Build Chatbots with Python Capstone" course.

I call this chatbot "First Aid Buddy" and it's trained on a very basic 'firstaidintents.json' file to assist users with any questions about First Aid.

You can ask it things like "how to treat a scrape" or "how to treat a sting". Feel free to update the JSON file with more responses.
