# first-aid-buddy

This is my Capstone project for Codecademy's "Build Chatbots with Python Capstone" course.

I call this chatbot "First Aid Buddy" and it's trained on a very basic 'firstaidintents.json' file to assist users with any questions about First Aid.

You can ask it things like "how to treat a scrape" or "how to treat a sting". Feel free to update the JSON file with more responses. 

If you do make additions to the training date, you will just need to run 'train.py' in order for the app to work with those new intents and responses.
